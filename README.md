AML Sanctions Detection

Overview

AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Sanctions Detection is a machine learning-based system designed to identify and flag transactions that violate financial sanctions regulations. This project leverages advanced data analytics, AI models, and compliance strategies to enhance financial security and prevent illicit activities.

Features

Automated Sanctions Screening: Identifies transactions linked to sanctioned entities.

Real-time Monitoring: Detects suspicious activities in financial transactions instantly.

Machine Learning Models: Utilizes AI/ML algorithms for pattern recognition and risk assessment.

Regulatory Compliance: Ensures adherence to AML laws and international sanctions lists.

Data Security & Privacy: Implements encryption and anonymization techniques to protect sensitive data.

Scalable & Modular Architecture: Easily integrates with existing financial systems.

Technologies Used

Python, SQL, Java (Core programming languages)

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)

Big Data Processing (Apache Spark, Pandas, or Dask)

API Development (FastAPI, Flask, or Django)

Database Management (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or MySQL)

Cloud & DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, or Azure)

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/AML-Sanctions-Detection.git
cd AML-Sanctions-Detection

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the database and environment variables.

Run the application:

python main.py

How It Works

Data Ingestion: The system collects transaction data from financial institutions.

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed.

Model Training & Inference: Machine learning models analyze transactions for anomalies and high-risk patterns.

Alert Generation: Suspicious transactions trigger alerts for further investigation.

Continuous Learning: The model improves over time with new data and feedback.

Roadmap
